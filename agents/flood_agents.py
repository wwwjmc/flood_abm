"""
The flood_agents module contains classes representing different entities within the flood simulation environment. 
These classes encapsulate the behaviors, attributes, and interactions of various agents present in the 
simulation environment.

- Person_Agent: Represents individuals within the simulation, each with unique attributes, behaviors, and responses to flooding events.
- House_Agent: Models residential units, managing residents and their reactions to flood risk and distress situations.
- Business_Agent: Represents commercial entities offering services, employing individuals, and interacting with the economy.
- School_Agent: Represents educational institutions providing services to students and interacting with the population.
- Shelter_Agent: Represents infrastructure responsible for rescuing stranded agents and providing support during flood events.
- Healthcare_Agent: Represents healthcare facilities supporting injured individuals during flood disasters.
- Government_Agent: Models the governing body responsible for managing taxes, supporting infrastructure, and public finances within the simulation environment.
